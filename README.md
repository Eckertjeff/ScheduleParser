# ScheduleParser
I do not own the contents of the "Welcome.html" file, it is simply an example of the input used for the program and is property of Wegmans Food Markets.

This program is very much a work in progress.

The idea of this project is to read in a .html file containing my work schedule, parse the contents looking for the important parts, then sync them with Google Calendar, and display the results to the user.

Future Expansions:

1) Enable fetching of the html page in-program using the HttpClient class.

2) Calendar sync support, to upload the schedule to an online calendar service. --- Implemented!

3) Automation, to have the program run weekly to fetch new schedule updates.

4) Porting to mobile platforms for ease of access.
