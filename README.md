# ScheduleParser
I do not own the contents of the "Welcome.html" file, it is simply an example of the input used for the program and is property of Wegmans Food Markets.

This program is very much a work in progress.

This progam will log you in to the scheduling server, get your schedule, and then upload it to google calendar.

Future Expansions:

1) Automation, to have the program run weekly to fetch new schedule updates.

2) Porting to mobile platforms for ease of access.
